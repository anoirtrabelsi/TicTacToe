# Tic Tac Toe AI

A basic implementation of the minimax algorithm to solve a game of Tic Tac Toe.

The AI always starts the game, playing as 'X'.

The User plays as 'O' and can choose any available spot on a 3x3 grid by clicking on it.

The program then computes its optimal next move using the Minimax algorithm.

The GUI was created using Pygame.
